E1;Egypt;Pioneers for the Future: Contributing to a more inclusive work environment for young women in Egypt;1-1-2019;12-31-2022;634848;The project constitutes a unique process of development based on a holistic and systemic approach, in compliance with the SDG’s roadmap and UN recommendations on the empowerment of women, including recommendations on the implementation of the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in Egypt. Through a mainstreaming and transformative approach, gender equality at work can be a key contribution to the full enjoyment of fundamental women’s rights. The project is the second phase of the ‘Pioneers for the Future’ project funded in Cairo by the Sawiris Foundation. It will build on the successes and lessons learned from the first phase as well as expand it to include national level advocacy on improving the work environment in Egypt, especially for women.;

If youth have access to employability, entrepreneurship, relevant technical and innovative skills to access either wage or self-employment opportunities; and key stakeholders have the capacity and understanding to promote gender supportive work and business environment, then those youth will earn income and develop confidence, improving their long-term capabilities and economic status.";
